Algorithm Powered games give you simple and clear explanations for algorithms and data structures used in some popular games. 
The main aim is to teach you algorithms and data structures in a fun way.

The content includes games that were developed using graph algorithms, binary search trees, linked lists, and sorting.
We then provide an overview of each of these algorithms and data structures and work you through how it was used in the development of the games in a mobile-friendly way, along with offline access.
